	ammo_tech_0_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 4 and above."
	ammo_tech_0_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War fired armor piercing solid shots (AP) or high-explosive shells (HE), new types of shells with explosive fillers (AP-HE) or shell add-ons like a penetration cap (AP-C) can ultimately killing power, which can also be filled with explosives (AP-HEC)."

	ammo_tech_1_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 8 and above."
	ammo_tech_1_desc:0 "Although better, solid shot shells still fail to be more than mere large bullets. Thus the search for shells that reliably destroy tanks and crews in single shots, with high-explosive anti-tank shells (HE-AT) or better penetration add-ons like a ballistic cap (APC-BC), which can also be filled with explosives (APHEC-BC)."

	ammo_tech_2_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 12 and above."
	ammo_tech_2_desc:0 "Facing heavier and heavier armor the new generation of shells will have to be specialized, with a hardened material or composite rigid core (AP-CR) like tungsten or with a firing launch sabot add-on (AP-DS). These shells are powerful, but more situational and their prohibitive production cost make them rare."
	ammo_tech_3:0 "Advanced Ammunition"
	ammo_tech_3_short:0 "2 Stage"
	ammo_tech_3_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 16 and above."
	ammo_tech_3_desc:0 "Facing heavier and heavier armor the new generation of shells will have to be of a bigger caliber, however loading larger shells in cramped tank interiors is proving to be a challenge. For this purpose, a solution is to store shells heads and propellants separately, with loading made in two stages (Two-Stage Ammunition)."

	ammo_tech_4_short:0 "HESH, HEATFS, APFSDS"
	ammo_tech_4_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 20 and above."
	ammo_tech_4_desc:0 "Where sometimes bigger is not better, rethinking the idea of shells can be a much better solution. For this, more elegant methods than brute force are invented. Such as, copper lined high-explosive shells (HE-SH) that 'squash and melt' through armor, add-on stabilizer fins for HEAT shells (HEAT-FS) that give much better tranjectory or very powerful thin solid 'long-darts' instead of shells which can also be combined with fins or a sabot (AP-FSDS)."
