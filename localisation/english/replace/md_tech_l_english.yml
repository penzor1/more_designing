	armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Limited by technology, riveted steel plates and cast monocoque hulls were the only fabrication choices in tank armor fabrication. With the popularization of industrial automated welding, wether through electric or gas use, welded steel becomes an affordable method of armor crafting that is cheaper than casting and quicker than riveting which requires bulky equipment."

#	armor_tech_4_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."

### NEW ###
	armor_tech_0:0 "Homogenous Armor"
	armor_tech_0_short:0 "IW Armor"
	armor_tech_0_desc:0 "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin wrought steel and low-carbonated steel armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
	engine_tech_0:0 "Inter-War Engine"
	engine_tech_0_short:0 "IW Engine"
	engine_tech_0_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern tank relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."

	ammo_tech_0_short:0 "IW Ammo"
	ammo_tech_0_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 4 and above."
	ammo_tech_0_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War fired armor piercing solid shots (AP) or high-explosive shells (HE), new types of shells with explosive fillers (AP-HE) or shell add-ons like a penetration cap (AP-C) can ultimately killing power, which can also be filled with explosives (AP-HEC)."

	ammo_tech_1_short:0 "1936 Ammo"
	ammo_tech_1_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 8 and above."
	ammo_tech_1_desc:0 "Although better, solid shot shells still fail to be more than mere large bullets. Thus the search for shells that reliably destroy tanks and crews in single shots, with high-explosive anti-tank shells (HE-AT) or better penetration add-ons like a ballistic cap (APC-BC), which can also be filled with explosives (APHEC-BC)."
	ammo_tech_2:0 "APCR, APDS Ammunition"
	ammo_tech_2_short:0 "1939 Ammo"
	ammo_tech_2_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 12 and above."
	ammo_tech_2_desc:0 "Facing heavier and heavier armor the new generation of shells will have to be specialized, with a hardened material or composite rigid core (AP-CR) like tungsten or with a firing launch sabot add-on (AP-DS). These shells are powerful, but more situational and their prohibitive production cost make them rare."
	ammo_tech_3:0 "2 Stage Ammunition"
	ammo_tech_3_short:0 "1942 Ammo"
	ammo_tech_3_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 16 and above."
	ammo_tech_3_desc:0 "Facing heavier and heavier armor the new generation of shells will have to be of a bigger caliber, however loading larger shells in cramped tank interiors is proving to be a challenge. For this purpose, a solution is to store shells heads and propellants separately, with loading made in two stages (Two-Stage Ammunition)."

	ammo_tech_4_short:0 "1944 Ammo"
	ammo_tech_4_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 20 and above."
	ammo_tech_4_desc:0 "Where sometimes bigger is not better, rethinking the idea of shells can be a much better solution. For this, more elegant methods than brute force are invented. Such as, copper lined high-explosive shells (HE-SH) that 'squash and melt' through armor, add-on stabilizer fins for HEAT shells (HEAT-FS) that give much better tranjectory or very powerful thin solid 'long-darts' instead of shells which can also be combined with fins or a sabot (AP-FSDS)."
