	tank_half_track_suspension_desc:0 "A hybrid system between a fully-tracked and a regular wheeled chassis, this setup has a pair of axled front steering wheels and a powered tracked axled rear. While limited in its carrying capacity, it is still cheaper than a fully-tracked design with the same improved cross-country performance over regular motorized vehicles."

 EQ_MOD_CAT_tank_armor_type_DESC:0 "The modern standard in steelmaking and unit of measurement of protection when comparing to other types of armor, measured as Rolled Homogeneous Armour equivalency (RHAe).

 	tank_riveted_armor_short:0 "Riveted RHA"
#	tank_riveted_armor_desc:0 "Rolled homogenous steel plates riveted together by the edges to a frame, to form an armored chassis. A very proven technology that is fairly cheap, but the riveted edges provide weakpoints in the armor, possibly splitting open and exposing the vehicle interior, or might hurt the crew if internal rivets are blow off by the kinetic shock of ammunition hits."
	tank_cast_armor:0 "Cast Homogenous Armor"
	tank_cast_armor_short:0 "Cast HA"
	tank_cast_armor_desc:0 "The entire Chassis, including armor, is cast with homogenous steel as a single unit to form an armored monocoque shell.

	tank_welded_armor:0 "Welded Rolled Homogenous Armor"
	tank_welded_armor_short:0 "Welded RHA"
#	tank_welded_armor_desc:0 "Rolled homogenous steel plates welded together by the edges to a frame, to form an armored chassis. Easier than riveting, without the downsides of bolts with the welded joints even acting as reinforced armor points and a cheaper process than casting, while still providing good protection."

	armor_skirts:0 "Stand-Off Armor"
	armor_skirts_desc:0 "A form of spaced armor, thin metal plates mounted on the sides of the vehicle hull and its turret, giving additional protection against anti-tank rifles and shaped charges by slowing down or detonating the projectile ealry before hitting the main hull."

	ammo_tech_0_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War fired armor piercing solid shots (AP) or high-explosive shells (HE), new types of shells with explosive fillers (AP-HE) or shell add-ons like a penetration cap (AP-C) can ultimately killing power, which can also be filled with explosives (AP-HEC)."

	ammo_tech_1_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 8 and above."
	ammo_tech_1_desc:0 "Although better, solid shot shells still fail to be more than mere large bullets. Thus the search for shells that reliably destroy tanks and crews in single shots, with high-explosive anti-tank shells (HE-AT) or better penetration add-ons like a ballistic cap (APC-BC), which can also be filled with explosives (APHEC-BC)."

	ammo_tech_2_tt:0 "Enables Firepower Upgrade values of 12 and above."
	ammo_tech_2_desc:0 "Facing heavier and heavier armor the new generation of shells will have to be specialized, with a hardened material or composite rigid core (AP-CR) like tungsten or with a firing launch sabot add-on (AP-DS). These shells are powerful, but more situational and their prohibitive production cost make them rare."

	ammo_tech_3_desc:0 "Facing heavier and heavier armor the new generation of shells will have to be of a bigger caliber, however loading larger shells in cramped tank interiors is proving to be a challenge. For this purpose, a solution is to store shells heads and propellants separately, with loading made in two stages (Two-Stage Ammunition)."

	ammo_tech_4_desc:0 "Where sometimes bigger is not better, rethinking the idea of shells can be a much better solution. For this, more elegant methods than brute force are invented. Such as, copper lined high-explosive shells (HE-SH) that 'squash and melt' through armor, add-on stabilizer fins for HEAT shells (HEAT-FS) that give much better tranjectory or very powerful thin solid 'long-darts' instead of shells which can also be combined with fins or a sabot (AP-FSDS)."
