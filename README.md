A mod dedicated to increase the use of the NSB dlc tank designer to all sorts of equipments.

 FEATURES :
Customizable Motorized, Mechanized and Armored Car chassis, similar to NSB tank chassis, usable by the AI. 1918 trucks, armored cars and mechs. Customize vehicles for transport, artillery, anti air or anti tank gun portee role, with modeled 3D sprites. 20 new custom slots for the 30 new modules, and +- upgrades. Many new gfx.


Difference with vehicles Arty, AA, TD and SPG Tanks:
+cheaper +less supply +less fuel +better garrison +participate in logistic
=same speed =same firepower
-less rough terrain mobile -less armor -weaker offensive -less reliable -diverted factories


UNDER CONSTRUCTION :

    NEW To add national 2D profile icon, module and tech icon gfx.
    NEW To add national chassis and variant equipment names.
    NEW Finishing integration of Extended Tank Designer (WIP)

GAME ISSUES : (ask paradox to fix it)

    Selecting truck roles is fiddly. Click modules or the reset button to "refresh" the chassis.
    Trucks in the armor production tab (vanilla locked).
    Cant add other designer roles (ie aa or arty), cant add a recon or armored role.
    Cant add trans-chassis roles. To convert trucks into apcs, apcs into scout cars, vice versa.
